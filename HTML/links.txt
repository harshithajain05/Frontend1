HTML links are hyperlinks.
You can click on a link and jump to another document.
When you move the mouse over a link, the mouse arrow will turn into a little hand.
Note: A link does not have to be text. A link can be an image or any other HTML element!

⁡⁢⁣⁢𝗛𝗧𝗠𝗟 𝗟𝗶𝗻𝗸𝘀⁡ - Syntax
The HTML <a> tag defines a hyperlink. It has the following syntax:
The most important attribute of the <a> element is the href attribute, which indicates the link's destination.

The link text is the part that will be visible to the reader.

By default, links will appear as follows in all browsers:
 1.An unvisited link is underlined and blue
 2.A visited link is underlined and purple
 3.An active link is underlined and red
⁡⁣⁣⁢𝗧𝗶𝗽:⁡ Links can of course be styled with CSS, to get another look!

By default, the linked page will be displayed in the current browser window. To change this, you must specify another target for the link.
The target attribute specifies where to open the linked document.
The target attribute can have one of the following values:

  _self - Default. Opens the document in the same window/tab as it was clicked
  _blank - Opens the document in a new window or tab
  _parent - Opens the document in the parent frame
  _top - Opens the document in the full body of the window
